## Personality Archetypes UI

Create 5 visually distinct personality cards:

## Mobile-First Requirements

- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px)
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Optimized for vertical video recording

## Viral Design Patterns

## Mock Data Structure

```typescript
interface PersonalityResult {
  archetype: 'philosopher' | 'meme-lord' | 'news-hawk' | 'builder' | 'chaos';
  stats: {
    totalTweets: number;
    avgWords: number;
    nightOwlScore: number;
    emojiUsage: number;
  };
  insights: string[];
  rarity: number; // percentage
}

// Sample data to use
const mockResults: PersonalityResult = {
  archetype: 'philosopher',
  stats: {
    totalTweets: 2847,
    avgWords: 23,
    nightOwlScore: 78,
    emojiUsage: 2.3
  },
  insights: [
    "You tweet your deepest thoughts at 2 AM when the world is quiet",
    "Your followers come to you for existential wisdom and life advice",
    "You've mastered the art of turning mundane moments into profound observations"
  ],
  rarity: 12
};
```
